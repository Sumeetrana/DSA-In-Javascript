# Map

#### Map is a collection of keyed data items, just like an Object. But the main difference is that Map allows keys of any type & it is also iterable

## Properties

- Unordered key-value pairs of data
- Can access elements via key (property name)
- Iterable(=you can use the for-of loop)
- Keys are unique, values are not
- Keys can be anything (incl. refernece values like arrays)
- Pure data storage, optimized for data access

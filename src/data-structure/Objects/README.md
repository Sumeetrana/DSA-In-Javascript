# Objects

##### An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.

## Properties

- Can access elements via key (property name)
- Not iterable (only with for-in)
- Keys are unique, values are not
- Keys have to numbers, strings or symbols
- Can store data & functionality (methods)
